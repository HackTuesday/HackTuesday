# Hack Tuesday

Welcome to Hack Tuesday!

## What is it?

Hack Tuesday is an informal group and a mentality. The goal is to set aside specific time a couple days a month to devote to playing with some new (usually web) technology. Well, it doesn't have to be _new_ per se, but something you or most people in the group haven't tried to use.

## When and where is it?

Tuesdays! More specifically, the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of each month. On the 2nd Tuesday of each month, you should find and visit your local [Build Guild](http://buildguild.org). For all other Tuesdays, we don't meet but you're encouraged to continue to play with the technology and commit to the repository.

We meet at Berkman Center for Internet and Society in Harvard. Berkman is located at 23 Everett St, Cambrige, MA. That shouldn't stop you from setting aside time on Tuesdays to hack at home.

## Meetup format

### 1st Tuesday

* briefly chat about previous topic, especially if something new was discovered/coded/pushed since we last met
* choose new topic

### 2nd Tuesday

* go to Build Guild!

### 3rd Tuesday

* continue to hack on projects started on 1st Tuesday
* if 1st Tuesday's topic proves boring or annoying, begin researching the new topic for next meetup

### 4th (and, possibly, 5th) Tuesday

* hack at home
* push code to repository

## Repository format

Each technology topic gets its own repository. Inside the repository, each member should create their own branch. Not much should go into the master branch unless we see a solid project forming. Feel free to cherry pick commits from other users' branches during development.
