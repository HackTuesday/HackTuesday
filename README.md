# Hack Tuesday

Welcome to Hack Tuesday!

## What is it?

Hack Tuesday is an informal group and a mentality. The goal is to set aside specific time a couple days a month to devote to playing with some new (usually web) technology. Well, it doesn't have to be _new_ per se, but something you or most people in the group haven't tried to use.

## When and where is it?

Tuesdays! More specifically, the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays of each month. On the 2nd Tuesday of each month, you should find and visit your local [Build Guild](http://buildguild.org).

We meet at Berkman Center for Internet and Society in Harvard. Berkman is located at 23 Everett St, Cambrige, MA. That shouldn't stop you from setting aside time on Tuesdays to hack at home.
